// worktree (`.kb/cache/worktrees/staging`), never on the vault root. The stages are
// root-agnostic, so handing them the staging worktree as their "root" makes all their existing
// logic (queues, markers, isolation worktrees, ff-advance) operate on `staging`. The vault
// root stays on `main` for Obsidian; the archivist's `afterDrain` hook runs the promotion gate
// (`promote`) to publish freshly-archived `sources/` from `staging` → `main`. Working state
// (inbox, entities, claims, candidates, the Review queue) lives only on `staging`.
//
// All stages share ONE canonical-writer lock per vault (SPEC-0014 §5): promotion + every stage
// ref-advance serialize through it.
